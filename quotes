I have always felt passionate about footwear. In kindergarten, kids sat cross-legged and I examined the sole designs rather than paying attention.  What was at first an obsession progressed into a full blown addiction. When I first started designing, my dream was to pursue happiness , doing the things I loved. In this industry we have the opportunity to make a difference in peopleâ€™s day to day life, affect how they push forward, how they feel, how they progress, and  overall have an impact on society. This is why I do what I love.

I have always encouraged my teams to not be afraid to make mistakes. We have to place ourselves outside of our comfort zones in order to get the best from ourselves. What we do is a constant development and the norm changes everyday. Therefore, we need to be immersed in the moment with out fear of being wrong to truly be free.
